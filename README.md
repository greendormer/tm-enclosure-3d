# tm-enclosure-3d

Included `.stl` files of the 3D enclosures to print via your FDM 3D Printer.

Notes:
- Recommend printing on ABS or ASA when used outdoors (these matrials are harder to work with)
- May print on PETG, but for UV protection, recommend painting it, starting with a good primer coat
- PLA may be used for indoor-only or test prints
